Prepare your graph so that you have separate nodes for your diffuse and for your alpha.  Then create an Alpha Merge node and input the diffuse and alpha into that.

Once that's done, make sure you have the Alpha Merge node selected, then click the disk icon in your 2D View window and save it out as a PNG.  The texture will export with a transparent background and is ready to use!
